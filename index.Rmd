Thank you everyone for the presence, today is my official presentation for you all,
I'm excited to know you all, even from the screem computer, but that is the safest way that we 
can do this at this moment.

So, I prepared this presentation to you. Hope that with this you can know a litle bit about me, 
who I am, both as a person and a researcher, and what brought me to here, in Corpus.

Despite to use this photo on my presentations you will realize that I'm not much into the field work 
to answer the questions that I try to answer in my research projects, but doesn't mean that I don't like to
be in contact with nature.

I'm a biologist, but as a Biologist this tweet defines much of who I am.
I really love nature and be in close contact, but I'm really dreadful at identifications

I also love to ride by bike, it's help me to moving arround the city and at the same time have some

Hope that I can find one here in Corpus soon

I'm also a enthusiast of photograph, whenever I can I grab my camera and go outside to take some photos. I
used to maintain I page with my photos on Flickr. My camera and my guitar were two of the few things that
I brought with me from Brazil

If I can list things for which Brazil is known abroad, maybe the first thing is the footbal.
Most of brazilians love this game and our national squad won five times the World Cup.

After that I earned my master degree at the same institution in Brazil, in which I investigated the factors
influencing the assembly of freshwater fish communities. During my master's thesis I started to use be familiar with numerical tools to detect patterns and processess acting in ecological communities, like
different diversity metrics, mathematical models and programming in R. 
I defended my master's thesis by presenting a new method to quantify the dimensionality of diversity in
freshwater fish communities.

Then, in 2015 I started my Phd in Ecology at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in the south region
of Brazil. Through 2015 to 2019 my research was guided by trying to answer which do we mean by biological 
diversity?

???

Particularly, during four years I've tried to understand how biodiversity is distributed over space, 
and how the best ways to measure it, so I developed a framework that helped in show which dimensions of biological diversity consist in the most important to capture the information contained in communities.
To do this I relied on the dimensionality concept and developed a updated framework to measure it.
This framework is described in that article and a R package to calculate the metrics are available in this
package.

???

Still with the aim to effectively represent biological diversity, I created new metrics to measure 
different components of beta diversity. Basically we extent a proposition from Legendre and De caceres
proposed in 2010 to accommodate different facets of beta diversity, like phylogenetic and functional in 
the same framework. This work is avaiable in this paper in Ecology journal and the metrics can be calculated
using the same package Dimensionality.

- Development of .green[Model-based] Phylogenetic metrics

- Unification Macroecology, Macroevolution and Community Ecology

???

Since my training were basically based in Community ecology theory and methods, I started to note that 
most of the metrics that we use in this field cannot be used to differentiate between contemporary and 
historical process acting on the assembly of community. Thus, to tackle this issue, I started to adapt the 
common metrics used in community ecology, like PD and PE, to be able to capture historical process. 

This was done by coupling these metrics with methods of ancestral area reconstruction. This allowed to 
decompose those metrics in a portion that represent the diversity generated by historical process like in-situ diversification and historical dispersal.
