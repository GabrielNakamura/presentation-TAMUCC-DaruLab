Thank you everyone for the presence, today is my official presentation for you all, some of you I already know, from the digital world and the scream computer, and now finally we have the opportunity to a in person meeting. Today I will give you a brief presentation of who I am, my research interesets and what I'm gonna do here at Texas A&M for the next three years.

Hope that I can find one here in Corpus soon

I also like music, specially guitar. Like to play doesn't mean that I know to play, so, I just play for fun, it helps me to clean my mind. Hope that my neighbors understand it.

If I can list things for which Brazil is known abroad, maybe the first thing is the football.
Most of brazilian people love this game and our national squad had won five times the World Cup.

Brazil is also very known for its nature. Here is one of the beatifull isolated beaches in the northeast 
of Brazil that I had the luck to be a few years ago.

## What influence the distribution of biological diversity on earth?

--

### Reliable description of biodiversity patterns accross space and time

--

### Search for the factors that generate these patterns

---

## Tools to describe different components of biodiversity (Ph.D)

```{r echo=FALSE}

```
]

.footnote[
Ecography paper [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.04574)
]

???
So, during my Ph.D I developed numerical tools to describe different components of biological diversity, with special focus on the development of numerical methods that allowed to describe alpha and beta diversity patterns.

--

.center2[
- Dimensionality concept 

- R package [.green[`Dimensionality`]](https://github.com/GabrielNakamura/Dimensionality_package)
]

???

Particularly, I developed a tool that allows to identify how to measure biological diversity when the focus is to maximize the amount o information present in ecological assemblages.
To do this I relied on the dimensionality concept and developed a updated framework to measure it.
This framework is described in that article and a R package to calculate the metrics are available in this
package.

- Beta diversity metrics that include .green[Phylogenetic, and
Functional dimensions]

- Also available in R package [.green[`Dimensionality`]](https://github.com/GabrielNakamura/Dimensionality_package)
]


???

Still with the aim to effectively represent biological diversity, I also developed a comprehensive framework to capture different components of beta diversity. Basically we extent a proposition from Legendre and De Caceres
proposed in 2010 to accommodate different facets of beta diversity, like phylogenetic and functional in 
the same framework. This work is available in this paper in Ecology journal and the metrics can be calculated using the same package Dimensionality that I mentioned early.

## What influence the distribution of biological diversity on earth?

???
As I said, capture effectively biodiversity patterns is just one 
step towards the understanding of the causes of biodiversity distribution on earth

--

### From patterns to process: searching for the causes

???
To fully answer this question we need to explain biodiversity patterns by searching for what generates it

--

#### How historical factors affect the current distribition of biological diversity?

???
And in the last year this is what I'm trying to do, specifically I'm interested in understand how processes associated with speciation and historical dispersal are responsible to generate the current patterns of
distribution in biological diversity

## Development of Methods in Historical Biogeography - Ongoing

knitr::include_graphics("images/Jetz_age_arrival.png")
```
.footnote[GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/GabrielNakamura/DivB_metrics)]

]

???
Now I'm developing methods in historical biogeography that disentangle the importance of in situ speciation
and historical dispersal to generate spatial patterns in Phylogenetic diversity of assemblages

--

.center2[
- Development of .green[Model-based] Phylogenetic metrics

- Unification Macroecology, Macroevolution and Community Ecology
]

???

Briefly I started to adapt common metrics used in community ecology, like PD and PE, and merge this metrics with macroevolutionary models, like ancestral area reconstruction, to be able to capture historical process.

For those who want to see more about the technical details, you can access github codes for this project and the package that Im calling, just for now, as Rrodotus.

## Biologically induced Side-effects

Like in a trip, the final destination is the objective, but in the middle of it you realize that there is a lot of other nice things that happen in the route

???
In my personal trip to find the answer for what influence biodiversity patterns in space and time I found myself developing some R packages, particularly related to manipulation of phylogenetic information, like 
FishPhyloMaker, that allows to obtain phylogenetic trees for fish species, check scientific names and calculate Darwinian shortfalls.

but also, as far as I can, I want to help undergrad and graduate students, I like to share and help whenever I can, I believe that 
we always have things to learn from other in the teaching proccess
